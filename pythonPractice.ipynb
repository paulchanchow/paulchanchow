A conditional statement is a type of **control statement**, in that it allows the programmer to control the logical \\`flow' of the program. In Python, the `if` and `else` statements can force a selection between 2 outcomes, depending whether some condition is met. For example,\n",

Other things you might notice are the use of `+` operator to **concatenate** (join) strings; use of the `==` **comparison operator** to check if 2 values are equal; the ability to perform multiple assignment; and the use of the built-in `str()` function to convert an integer to a string.\n",
